GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions   
WHEN I enter my project title   
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests   
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options   
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
