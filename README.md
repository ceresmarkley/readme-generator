THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests   
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options   
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
